# Hail-algorithm
This is a probabilistic hail model. The original model has been developed by Andreas Prein and is described in the paper by Prein and Holland, 2018. 

This project is a collaboration between NCAR, ETHZ, and SwissRe. We use ERA-5 reanalysis data in order to improve the original model, which was based on ERA-INTERIM. 

In this folder, the code for the model can be found in the file Synthetic_Hail_Model_modified-final2.py.
