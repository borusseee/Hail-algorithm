# Hail-algorithm
Here you will find the Python code used to calculate hail probabilities. The original model has been developed by Andreas Prein and is described in the paper by Prein and Holland, 2018. 
In this repository, the main hail calculation program is in the Python file called Synthetic_Hail_Model_modified.py.
